    <!-- AI vs ML -->
    <h2>“So what’s the difference between AI and Machine Learning?”</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>AI</strong> is the goal.<br />
      <strong>Machine Learning</strong> is one way to reach that goal.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI is about making computers do things that look intelligent.<br />
      Machine Learning is how we teach computers — by showing them examples instead of writing rules.
    </p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <p><strong>Think of it like this:</strong></p>
      <p>
        AI is learning to ride a bicycle.<br />
        Machine Learning is practicing again and again until you stop falling.
      </p>

    <!-- AI vs Model -->
    <h2>“Then what’s the deal with AI and models?”</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>AI</strong> is the idea.<br />
      <strong>A model</strong> is the thing that actually does the work.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI is the concept of making machines act smart.<br />
      A model is a trained system that takes input and gives output.
    </p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <p><strong>Another way to think about it:</strong></p>
      <p>
        AI is the idea of cooking.<br />
        A model is a specific recipe.
      </p>

    <!-- Misconceptions -->
    <h2>Some common myths about AI</h2>

    <p><strong>“So AI thinks like a human, basically?”</strong></p>
    <p>
      Not really.<br />
      AI doesn’t think — it guesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It predicts what comes next based on patterns it has seen before.
    </p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <p>
        Think of autocorrect… but on steroids.
      </p>
      <p style="opacity: 0.8;">
        DUCK → DUCKING → DUCKING HELL
      </p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>“But AI understands meaning, right?”</strong></p>
    <p>
      AI only knows which words usually appear together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine someone who learned a language by reading subtitles —<br />
      they can form sentences, but they don’t truly understand them.
    </p>

    <p><strong>“AI is always right.”</strong></p>
    <p>
      Nuh uh.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI can be confidently wrong — like that one person you know who answers fast and very, very wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI just guesses.<br />
      Sometimes, those guesses are bad.
