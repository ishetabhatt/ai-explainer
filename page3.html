    <h1>So what is AI, really?</h1>

    <p class="big-text">
      <strong>AI is a computer that learns from examples instead of following fixed rules.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Normal software follows instructions written by humans.
      <br />
      AI looks at lots of examples and learns patterns from them.
    </p>

    <h2>Think of it like this</h2>

    <div class="example-box">
      <p><strong>Calculator:</strong></p>
      <p>
        You give it a formula.<br />
        It follows the rule exactly.
      </p>

      <p><strong>AI:</strong></p>
      <p>
        You give it examples.<br />
        It learns the pattern.
      </p>

    <h2>Some common terms you’ll hear</h2>

    <div class="terms">
      <p>
        <strong>Algorithm</strong><br />
        A computer recipe. Every program follows instructions — AI just uses much fancier ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Model</strong><br />
        A math-based pattern finder. It doesn’t remember examples — it remembers patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Training data</strong><br />
        Examples used to teach the model. Better examples usually mean better AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Machine learning</strong><br />
        Letting the computer learn patterns from data instead of hard-coding rules.
